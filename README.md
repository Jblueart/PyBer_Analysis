## Overview

Purpose to comb thru ride sharing data to determine key metricts to compare and contrast rides by city type, namely urban, rural & suburban adoption of the service. Scope, total rides, driver count, fares & average fare per ride & driver.

## Results

Major Marketing efforts should continue in Urban areas & Suburban areas. Rural areas are the least likely to use our services, but tend to have higher fares, though fewer rides per city. 

Clear Economy of scale demonstrated by noticing the popularity of the service in Urban, the service also tends to be less expensive for the consumer so more consumers are relying upon Pyber to go about their daily lives.
